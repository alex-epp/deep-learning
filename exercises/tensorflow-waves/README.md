# TensorFlow Waves

A wave equation solver based on https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/pdes.

I'm pretty sure there is a bug, since the oscillations eventually increase until the errors overwelm any actual wave characteristics.

I have another example that works closer to how I envisioned this one would (but without TensorFlow) [here](https://github.com/alex-epp/waves/).
